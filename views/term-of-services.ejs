                    <p>All disputes involving but not limited to rights conferred, compensation, refunds, and other claims will be resolved through a two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism.</p>

                      <li>Stage 1: Mediation.

The decision of the mediator is not binding on both parties.</li>
                      <li>Stage 2: Arbitration. In case that mediation does not yield a result suitable or preferred by any one of the parties, arbitration may follow, the award of which is binding on both parties. The Arbitration Board shall comprise three members – one appointed by each party and the third member to be nominated by the two appointed members by mutual consent. Arbitration shall be held at Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India. The proceedings of arbitration shall be in the English language. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on the Parties.</li>
